Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

The tokenizer will prompt the user for a string to tokenize. The user can exit
the program by entering 'x' in the console.

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine
